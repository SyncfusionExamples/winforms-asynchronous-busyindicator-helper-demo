# Asynchronous Busy Indicator Helper Demo for Windows Forms
Usually, an animated GIF image cannot be shown in a Windows Forms control without using the picture box control or writing our own custom control. The busy indicator drawing helper helps you show animated GIF images in a control. The main advantage of this helper is that you can use it in any Windows Forms control, regardless of whether it is a Syncfusion control. The busy indicator drawing helper can also be used asynchronously.

## About the sample
This sample shows how to show the busy indicator asynchronously in a control.
